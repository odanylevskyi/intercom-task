##Question:

_What's your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. 
Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, what impact it had (If any) and any insights 
you took from it._

------------------
I am really proud of my graduate project. I worked on speech synthesis problems for Ukrainian language. It was very interesting project. This project was implemented in another project that was developed by the team from the Institute of Cybernetics. The project solve real-life problems. I had made text-to-speech library for 3D human model. The library was created using C++. The library plays typed from the keyboard text and combines the audio file with 3D human model mouse and hand movement. 
For me it was really important project not because it was my graduate project but because the project (3D human model) helps deaf people to study to talk. I am still watching for the project. There is a new students who started to work with my library. I see that my work takes a really big part in the project. 
This project gave me excellent knowledge in programming, audio processing and developed my analytical and communication skills.
